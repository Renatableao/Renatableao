- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Renatableao, 34 years old, brazilian, married and mother of Vitor (3y) and Manuela (1y). 
- I graduated in Public Administration, worked in the area for few years but it wasn't quite me, so I quit and started my own business. 
- When I got pregnant I decided to be a full time mum.
- Iâ€™m currently learning programming because I always found it very interesting and I'm hoping I will be able to do something of my own at some point.
