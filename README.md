- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Renatableao, 36 years old, brazilian, married and mother of Vitor (5y) and Manuela (3y). 
- I graduated in Public Administration, worked in the area for few years but it wasn't quite me, so I quit and started my own business. 
- When I got pregnant I decided to be a full time mum.
- When I felt ready to return, I took the initiative to teach myself programming, which eventually led to my first opportunity in the field.
- Over the past year, I've immersed myself in backend development, welcoming challenges and experiencing personal and professional growth along the way.
